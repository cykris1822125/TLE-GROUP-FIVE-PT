suffer on their own finances. Affects people's lives physically, mentally and spiritually as 
well. When we take a look at on it's bright side we get to know ourself here, with a span of 
time we focus on how to grow our self confidence, and even let us realize a lot of things like 
how to handle our finances. And reflect to our own doings. Covid-19 has advantage and 
disadvantages in some ways, is that how people deal and react to it.<br><br>

Nowadays, many people are still suffering because of Covid 19. And still the virus still there 
and many people loss their job, main income, affect businesses and the income that they spend 
towards their Family is not suitable anymore and all they need to do is to save the money and 
spend it in buying groceries that are needed. Both Positive and negative affects the Covid 19 to 
us the positive is our surroundings is sanitize clean and they following the protocols like 
wearing mask and always bringing alcohol. The negative is that many people are struggling on how 
to communicate with their business beacuse we all know that we meet through zoom and sometimes 
we didn't know when the signal is okay and not okay. So still we are waiting for the good 
updates and praying to back to normal.</center></font size></b>

We choosed anchor as a Symbol for hope because it reminds us that we are anchored to God and 
that he's our hope and salvation.  It represents our faith in him and to served as a 
testimony.<br> 
 Anchor indicates God's promise or salvation to the people who believes in him, that's why 
Anchor is a symbol for the unfailing hole to those who believe.
Anchor is a representation of hope for us Christians. It is also a symbol for safety and 
strength. A person can also be an anchor by supporting someone when they need someone to stay by 
their side.<br>
For me, anchor represents hope because we hope for salvation through God. This served to 
indicate the immovability of his promise.
Anchor is a symbol for hope because it represents a new adventure for us. We are hoping for what 
to expect and to come to our new voyage. Our hope encourages us to stay strong and steadfast in 
any problems that are ahead of us.</center></b></font size><br><br>
